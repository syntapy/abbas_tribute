*The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord* ~Abdul-Baha

My first CSS project for [freecodecamp](freecodecamp.org): A tribute to Abbas Effendi (also known as Abdul-Baha), Who led the Baha'i community and taught that we are happier when we appreciate diversity and act with compassion

Currently a WIP and initially designed using Figma
