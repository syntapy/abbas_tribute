My first CSS project for [freecodecamp](freecodecamp.org): A tribute to Abbas Effendi (also known as Abdul-Baha), Who led the Baha'i community and taught the world that we are happier when we appreciate diversity and act with compassion

Currently a WIP and initially designed using Figma

Tested in Firefox 88 for mobile sized screen with a width of 333px
